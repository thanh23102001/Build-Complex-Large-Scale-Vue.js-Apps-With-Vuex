# Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [How to Build Complex, Large-Scale Vue.js Apps With Vuex][published url]
## Instructor: [Ivaylo Gerchev][instructor url]

It's so easy to learn and use Vue.js that anyone can build a simple application with that framework. Even novices, with the help of Vue's documentation, can do the job. However, when complexity comes into play the things get a bit more serious. The truth is that multiple, deeply nested components with shared state can quickly turn your application into an unmaintainable mess.

The main problem in a complex application is how to manage the state between components without writing spaghetti code or producing side effects. In this tutorial you'll learn how to solve that problem by using Vuex: a state management library for building complex Vue.js applications.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
